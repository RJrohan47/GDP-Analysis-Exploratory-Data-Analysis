# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-ON Gross-Domestic-Product using Python

**The purpose of this project is to analyze the GDP growth of each country with  Explorartory data Analysis**

### Goals of the Project:
1.Explore GDP of each country with respect to world <br>
2. Visualize the dataset with various plot types. <br>

### Dataset Description
The dataset contains GDP values of various countries across different years. It includes economic indicators and possibly other socio-economic variables that can influence or reflect economic performance.

1. Country Name
2. Country Code
3. Year
4. Value
5.GDP (current US$)

### Objective
Analyze global and regional GDP trends over time.

Identify the fastest-growing and declining economies.

Visualize economic disparities across countries or continents.

Prepare clean and insightful data that can be used for forecasting or policy analysis.


###  Outline

General part : i) Libraries import ii) Dataset exploration iii) Pivot tables iv) Visualization in Pandas
Tasks
### Materials and methods:
The data that we are going to use is available in kaggle and we have imported the data set 

This dataset is publicly available for research. 

In this project , from our actual data set we compare the growth values for each country and created an additional column for finding GDP 
Then we have analyzed the GDP of each country as compare to World GDP in a given time frame 
We have used Matplolib for data visulatisation for interactive analysis.


### Conclusion
This GDP EDA project offers a deep dive into global economic data, identifying patterns and disparities in development. The insights gained can support data-driven decisions, economic research, and future forecasting models.
Using plotly library we have visualised data more efficiently and saved it in our local system.
