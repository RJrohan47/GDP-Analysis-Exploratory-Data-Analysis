# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-ON Gross-Domestic-Product using Python

**The purpose of this project is to analyze the GDP growth of each country with  Explorartory data Analysis**

### Goals of the Project:
1.Explore GDP of each country with respect to world <br>
2. Visualize the dataset with various plot types. <br>
###  Outline
Materials and methods
General part : i) Libraries import ii) Dataset exploration iii) Pivot tables iv) Visualization in Pandas
Tasks
### Materials and methods:
The data that we are going to use is available in kaggle and we have imported the data set 

This dataset is publicly available for research. 

In this project , from our actual data set we compare the growth values for each country and created an additional column for finding GDP 
Then we have analyzed the GDP of each country as compare to World GDP in a given time frame 
We have used Matplolib for data visulatisation for interactive analysis.
Using plotly library we have visualised data more efficiently and saved it in our local system.


## USED LIBRARIES:
**NUMPY**<br>
**PANDAS**<br>
**MATPLOTLIB**<br>
**PLOTLY**<br>
